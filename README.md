# Classification and Variable Selection Exercise

This exercise is a Classification problem, with target variable having two levels (-1 and 1) and a high number of candidates for explanatory variables. **Variable selection** is performed using Random Forests with the **VSURF** package. Out of a couple of hundreds of variables, only a few are shown to be relevant. Predictions are then made using **Logistic Regression** and **Classification Tree** models, which are compared by calculating accuracy.
